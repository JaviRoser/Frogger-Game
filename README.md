# Frogger Game Project

Udacity's Classic Arcade Game

This project was developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 

In this game, we have a player and several enemies (bugs). The player must reach the water without being touched by any enemy to win the game. We can move the player left, right, up, and down using the keyboard. The speed of the enemies varies as the player approaches to the water. If the enemy collides with player, the game is reset, and the player moves back to the start square.
